    <p>A rack is the smallest size designation for a Hadoop environment. A rack consists of all the necessary power, the network cabling and the two Ethernet switches necessary to support up to 15 data nodes. A rack should use its own power and space within the data center, separate from other racks, and should be treated as a fault zone.</p>
