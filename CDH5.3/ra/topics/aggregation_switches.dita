  <title>Cluster Aggregation Switches</title>
  <shortdesc>For clusters consisting of one more pods, the architecture uses either of the following for aggregation switches:</shortdesc>
  <body>
    <ul>
      <li>Force10 S4810</li>
      <li>Force10 Z9000</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The choice depends on the initial size and planned scaling. The Force10 S4810-based aggregation design is preferred for lower cost and medium scalability. This design can handle up to six racks or two pods. The Z9000 is recommended for larger deployments.</p>
    <p>Like the ToR switches, the aggregation switches are also connected in pairs using VLT. The uplink from each S4810 ToR switch to the aggregation pair is 80Gb, using a pair of 40G interfaces Since both S4810â€™s connect to the aggregation pair, there is a collective bandwidth of 160G available from each rack.</p>
