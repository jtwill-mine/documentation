  <title>Logical Volume Manager (LVM)</title>
  <body>
    <p>Logical Volume Manager (LVM) is a basic service provided by the kernel that can be used to create a volume that is used in conjunction with the iSCSI drivers to create volumes and mount them to Virtual Machines. Cinder can use this method when other options are unavailable.</p>

            <entry>Use only for single-node evaluations and Proof of Concept. This is available only
              in the Dell PoC bundle. Not recommended for data requiring high availability, fault
              resiliency, spanning multiple nodes or scale-out model with redundancy.</entry>

            <entry>Use for low-cost, scale-out storage, ideal as volume backend for Nova VMs and
              also an object store Perfect for Dev/Test, back-up and storage-as-a-service use cases.
              Not recommended for very high-performance and database applications.</entry>
