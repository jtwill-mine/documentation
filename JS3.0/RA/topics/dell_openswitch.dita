  <shortdesc>In addition to the Dell switch-based Reference Architecture, Dell provides an open standard that enables you to choose other brands and configurations of switches for your OpenStack environment.</shortdesc>
  <body>
    <p>You are expected to ensure that the switches conform to these requirements, and that they are
      configured according to this reference architectureâ€™s guidelines. The following list of
      requirements will enable other brands of switches to properly operate with Dell's required
      tools and configurations:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Support for IEEE 802.1Q vLAN traffic and port tagging</li>
      <li>Support using one untagged and multiple tagged vLANs on the same port</li>
      <li>Ability to provide a minimum of 170 Gigabit Ethernet ports in a non-blocking configuration
        within Provisioning vLAN<ul id="ul_arv_rjr_gq">
          <li>Configuration can be a single switch or a combination of stacked switches to meet the
            additional requirements</li>
        </ul></li>
      <li>The ability to create link aggregation groups (LAGs) with a minimum of two physical links in each LAG</li>
      <li>If multiple switches are stacked:<ul id="ul_bwr_5jr_gq">
          <li>The ability to create a LAG across stacked switches</li>
          <li>Full-bisection bandwidth</li>
          <li>Support for vLANs to be available across all switches in the stack</li>
        </ul></li>
      <li>250,000 packets-per-second capability per switch</li>
